# Intro

The SQL 101 course is designed for someone aspiring to build a career as data engineer, analyst, or  a data scientist. This course covers fundamental SQL concepts, including querying, database design, and data manipulation. learning to extract insights and support data-driven decision-making.

By the end of the course, you will be writing complex queries, optimizing database performance, and using SQL to solve practical problems.

## Recommened Programs

* [DBeaver Community](https://dbeaver.io/)
* [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)

You may also use any other database engine you feel comfortable with however the create database statement may need to be adjusted. It maybe also be that some functions are not in your chosen engine or are named differently.

## Setup

To participate please fork the [repo](https://github.com/Tom-Fynes/sql-101) and follow one of the setup documents. please save your queries [here](https://github.com/Tom-Fynes/sql-101/tree/main/Exercises). Also while going through the corse if you find an issue or think of an improvement please log an issue [here](https://github.com/Tom-Fynes/sql-101/issues)
