Although there are hundreds of good themes avaliable in VS code sometimes you just want to be able to put your own touch on things, which in this post is exactly what we are going to do.

## Prerequisites

Before we start we will need to make sure we have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm

## Getting started

Okay now we have the prereqisites installed we can get started, and for this we will need a colour palete.

For me, I didn't have any colours in mind when I started thinking about creating a theme so I used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/f1f7ee-b0bea9-92aa83-e0edc5-e7f59e). Coolers offers a few usful tools but for this project we will use the colour pallet generator to randomly get a set of colours we can use.
